### Tool box: ADHD friendly timer

The traditional 25-minute Pomodoro timer isn't suitable for individuals with ADHD because they find it harder to get into a state of focus. However, once they're in that state, they can maintain intense concentration. The 25-minute interval is impractical for them, as it interrupts their flow and adds more pressure. Therefore, we've designed a customizable timer where you can focus for longer periods, even if you want to concentrate for three hours straight.
Please click on the numbers on the dial to set the time.
